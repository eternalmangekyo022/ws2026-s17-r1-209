##### 1.2.1.2 Mobile view (hamburger)

On mobile view, a hamburger menu is used to save up space in the header.

- Only the logo and a hamburger icon are visible initially.
- **Clicking** the hamburger button opens a menu styled according to the [design](./media/phase-1/design/design-hamburger.png).
- The menu can be **closed** by **clicking the `X` button or by clicking outside the menu** _(on the blurred background)_.
- Please keep in mind, that you are **not** allowed to use JavaScript in this phase.

### 1.3 Responsiveness

- Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the website looks appealing across **all screen sizes.**
- **The page should also work seamlessly on other screen sizes.** When shrinking, the elements should not stick to the edge of the screen, and the text should not overflow. The content should be in a **container**, so enlarging the screen keeps the size.
- Use relative size units, so changing the font size in the browser settings also shrinks/enlarges the content accordingly.

### 1.6 Validation

The website will thoroughly test on the latest stable versions of **Google Chrome**. W3C also will be used to check for HTML and CSS validity.  
Lighthouse will be used for accessibility and SEO testing. Every lighthouse aspect should be green on both desktop and mobile.
