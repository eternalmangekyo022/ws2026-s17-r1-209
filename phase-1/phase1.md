On mobile view, a hamburger menu is used to save up space in the header.

- Only the logo and a hamburger icon are visible initially.
- **Clicking** the hamburger button opens a menu styled according to the [design](./media/phase-1/design/design-hamburger.png).
- The menu can be **closed** by **clicking the `X` button or by clicking outside the menu** _(on the blurred background)_.
- Please keep in mind, that you are **not** allowed to use JavaScript in this phase.

### 1.3 Responsiveness

- Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the website looks appealing across **all screen sizes.**
- **The page should also work seamlessly on other screen sizes.** When shrinking, the elements should not stick to the edge of the screen, and the text should not overflow. The content should be in a **container**, so enlarging the screen keeps the size.
